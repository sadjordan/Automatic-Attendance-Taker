# My (Jordan's) Automatic Attendance Taker
*use at your own risk



## How to use:
1. You can download it from the .apk file named "attendance_taker.apk" in this repository.
2. Add "users" — you and your fellow MMU students' student ID and passwords
3. Scan a QR code

## Known issues
1. Sometimes when you scan a QR code after opening the app for the first time, the site will not load. Simply scan the QR code again.
2. Sometimes the app doesn't close your camera fast enough after scaning a QR code and you get the box to open the scanned website again (no solution for this cus I'm lazy)
3. QR can't be scanned: Your camera's issue
